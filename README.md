# Triped
Business rule driven data processing

####What
A proof of concept using node that processes input data against a set of business rules 

####Why
Reduce complexity of evolving systems compared to traditional methods of apis and datafeeds by creating dynamic code to process input directly from the logic and rules explicitly stated in a set of business rules  

####Inspiration
This problem has come up in so many projects that we decided to lay out a proof of concept on how to approach the problem.

####How
Using many libraries that are already avaiable it is fairly simple to lay out a process that allows data to be both processed and displayed directly via a set of business rules by creating a lexer and solver that performs actions based on a DSL that is defined by the user.
